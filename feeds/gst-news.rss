<title>[Registration] Advisory for Simplified GST Registration Scheme</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><b>Dear Taxpayers,</b></p>

<p>In pursuance of Rule 14A of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Rules, 2017, a <i>Simplified GST Registration Scheme</i> has been introduced to reduce the compliance burden and enhance the ease of doing business for small taxpayers.</p>

<p>As per Rule 14A (Option for taxpayers having a monthly output tax liability below the prescribed threshold limit), any person who, on his own assessment, feels that his total output tax liability on the supply of goods or services, or both, to registered persons will not exceed Rs.2.5 lakh per month (including CGST, SGST/UTGST, IGST, and Compensation Cess) shall be eligible to register under this scheme. However, a person registered under this rule in a State or Union Territory shall not be eligible to obtain another registration in the same State or Union Territory under this rule against the same PAN.</p>

<p><b>Key Features Implemented on the GST Portal:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• While applying for registration in FORM GST REG-01, applicants should select "Yes" under the <i>"Option for Registration under Rule 14A."</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Aadhaar authentication is mandatory for the Primary Authorized Signatory and at least one Promoter/Partner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Registration shall be granted electronically within three working days from the date of generation of the Application Reference Number (ARN), subject to successful Aadhaar authentication.</p>

<p>Taxpayers opting for registration under Rule 14A are advised to take note of the following conditions, in case they intend to withdraw from the Scheme at a later stage:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• All returns due from the effective date of registration up to the date of filing the withdrawal application must be filed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The taxpayer must have filed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Returns for a period of minimum three months, if applying for withdrawal before 1st April 2026, or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Returns for a period of minimum one tax period, if applying for withdrawal on or after 1st April 2026.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• No amendment or cancellation application for registration availed under rule 14A should be pending.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• No proceedings under Section 29 (cancellation of registration) for registration availed under rule 14A should be initiated or pending.</p>



Thanking You, <br>

<title>[Returns] Advisory : Introduction of Import of Goods details in IMS</title>
<description><![CDATA[
 
<ul><p>The Invoice Management System (IMS) was introduced on the GST portal from the October 2024 tax period. It enables recipient taxpayers to accept, reject, or keep pending their individual records uploaded by their suppliers through GSTR-1/1A/IFF.  To further enhance the taxpayer convenience, a new section for "Import of Goods" has been introduced in IMS wherein the Bill of Entry (BoE) filed by the taxpayer for import of goods including import from SEZ, will be made available in the IMS for taking allowed action on individual BoE. This functionality will be available from Oct-2025 period onwards. </p></ul>

<ul><p>It may be noted that, If no action is taken on an individual BoE, it will be treated as deemed accepted and based on the action taken, the GST Portal will generate the draft GSTR 2B for the recipient on 14th of subsequent month. Please <a href="https://tutorial.gst.gov.in/downloads/news/creative_advisory_on_boe_in_ims_final_30th_october_2025.pdf" target="blank"> click here </a>to read the detailed advisory on the new changes.</p></ul>

<title>[Returns] Attention : Important Advisory on IMS</title>
<description><![CDATA[
 
<p> It has come to notice that some posts are circulating incorrect information regarding changes in GST return filing from October 1, 2025. We would like to clarify the following: </p>

<p>I.    No Change in Auto-Population of ITC:
Input Tax Credit (ITC) will continue to auto-populate from GSTR-2B to GSTR-3B without any manual intervention. The mechanism of auto-population remains unchanged due to the implementation of the Invoice Management System (IMS).</p>

<p>II.   GSTR-2B Generation
<ul>
<li>    GSTR-2B will continue to be generated automatically on the 14th of every month, without any manual intervention by taxpayers or based on the actions taken by the taxpayers.
<li>    Taxpayers can take actions in IMS even after generation of GSTR-2B till filing of GSTR-3B and can regenerate GSTR-2B accordingly, if required.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>III.  Credit Note Handling (Effective October 2025 period onward)
<ul>
<li>    Recipient taxpayers will have the option to keep a Credit Note or related document pending for a specified period.</li>
<li>    On acceptance of Credit Note or related document, the recipient will also have the flexibility to reduce ITC only to the extent of its availment by adjusting the reversal amount manually.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<title>[Returns] Advisory: New Changes in Invoice Management System (IMS)</title>
<description><![CDATA[
 
<p>This is to bring to your notice that several new changes have been introduced in the Invoice Management System (IMS) to simplify the taxation system and reduce the compliance burden on the taxpayers. The following are the key updates </p>

<p><b>Pending action for specified records:</b> Taxpayers can keep specified records pending for a limited time period. For monthly taxpayers, this period is one tax period (months), for quarterly taxpayers also it is one tax period (quarter) only. The specified records which can be kept pending in the system are mentioned below</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Credit notes, or upward amendment of Credit note </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	 Downward amendment of CN where original CN rejected</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Downward amendment of Invoice / DN only where original Invoice already accepted and 3B has been filed  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	ECO-Document downward amendment only where original accepted, and 3B has been filed</p>

<p><b>Declaring ITC reduction amount: </b></p>

<p>It is clarified that, in cases where the recipient has not availed Input Tax Credit (ITC) in respect of the relevant invoice or document, no reversal of ITC shall be warranted. Further, in cases where ITC has been availed only partially, the obligation to reverse ITC shall be limited to the extent of such availment.</p>


<p>Therefore, In IMS a facility has been made available to taxpayers to declare the amount of ITC actually availed and, to the extent applicable, required to be reversed in respect of the selected record. The said facility permits reversal of ITC, either in full or in part, by entering the amount availed to be reversed. This facility may also be utilized in cases where the taxpayer has already effected such reversal, either wholly or partially, at an earlier point of time, or where the ITC pertaining to the relevant invoice or document was never availed.  Such facility is provided for the afore-mentioned specified records. </p>


<p><b>Option to save remarks:</b> Taxpayers can now save remarks while taking reject or pending action on records. This optional facility allows taxpayers to add remarks (will be rolled out shortly). Such remarks will be visible in GSTR-2B for future reference and to suppliers in the Outward Supplies view dashboard, to take corrective measures.</p>

<p><b>Important Dates:</b></p>

<p>The changes of keeping credit notes pending and declaring the ITC amount, as mentioned above shall be made effective on the portal from October tax period.  </p>

<p>Due date for keeping records pending: The due date for keeping records pending is calculated based on the date/ tax period in which such documents has been communicated by the supplier.</p>

<p><b>Prospective Application:</b></p>

<p>The new changes will be available only for records filed by suppliers after the production rollout of these changes. Taxpayers are advised to carefully review these changes before taking action and filing their returns.</p>

<title>[Refunds] Advisory –System Enhancement for Order-Based Refunds</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>1. As per the available functionality, taxpayers could claim refunds under the category "On account of Assessment/Enforcement/Appeal/Revision/Any Other Order" (ASSORD) only if:</p>

<ul>• &nbsp;&nbsp; The cumulative amount of the Demand ID showed a negative balance (i.e., refund eligible).</ul>
<ul>• &nbsp;&nbsp; The status of the Demand ID was "Refund Due".</ul>

<p>This restriction prevented taxpayers from claiming refunds when individual components (minor heads) of a demand showed negative balances and the overall cumulative balance was zero or positive.</p>

<p>2. For the above scenario, several references have been made by the tax payers and tax officers stating that the taxpayers are not able to claim the refund. Accordingly the following changes have been implemented in the system:</p>

<ul>• &nbsp;&nbsp; Refunds can now be claimed irrespective of the Demand ID status.</ul>
<ul>• &nbsp;&nbsp; Refunds are allowed even when the cumulative balance is positive or zero, provided any minor head has a negative balance.</ul>
<ul>• &nbsp;&nbsp; Only negative balances will be auto-populated in the refund application (Form RFD-01); taxpayers cannot claim any refund for the positive amounts within the demand.</ul>
<ul>• &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Order Number Suggestions:</b> The system automatically suggests the most recent demand order associated with a negative balance such as <i>order-in-original, rectification order or appellate order</i> etc.</ul>
<ul>• &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Tooltips:</b> Clear guidance is provided near the <b>Order No.</b> and <b>Demand ID</b> fields to help taxpayers enter the correct details.</ul>

<p>3. A comprehensive user manual and FAQs will be shared shortly. In case of any discrepancies or system-related queries, a ticket may be raised with the GST helpdesk.</p>

<title>[Returns] Advisory: Regarding GSTR-3A Notices issued for non-filing of form GSTR 4 to cancelled Composition Taxpayers </title>
<description><![CDATA[


<p>As per the provisions of Section 39(2) of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017, read with Rule 68 of the CGST Rules, 2017, notices in Form GSTR-3A are required to be issued in cases of non-filing of Form GSTR-4. However, it has come to notice that, due to a system-related glitch, such notices have been inadvertently issued in certain cases where they were not applicable — including instances involving taxpayers whose registrations had been cancelled prior to the Financial Year 2024–25.</p>

<p>2.	The issue is currently under active examination, and the technical team is implementing appropriate corrective measures to ensure that such instances do not recur. In the meantime, taxpayers who have either duly filed the relevant return or whose registrations were cancelled prior to the Financial Year 2024–25 are advised to ignore these notices, as no further action is required on their part in such cases.</p>

<p>3.	For any other issues or concerns, taxpayers are advised to raise a grievance through the Self-Service Portal available on the GST Portal, along with all relevant details, to facilitate prompt and effective resolution.</p>

<title>[Returns] Handling of Inadvertently Rejected records on IMS</title>
<description><![CDATA[
 
<p><b>Question 1: How can a recipient avail ITC of wrongly rejected Invoices/ Debit notes/ECO-Documents in IMS as corresponding GSTR-3B of same tax period was also filed by recipient?</b></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> In such cases recipient can request to the corresponding supplier to report the same record (without any change) in same return period’s GSTR-1A or respective amendment table of subsequent GSTR-1/IFF. Thus, recipient can avail the ITC basis on amended record by accepting such record on IMS and recomputing GSTR-2B on IMS. Here the recipient will get ITC of complete amended value as original record was rejected by the recipient.</p>
<p>However, recipient will be able to take ITC for the again furnished document by the supplier, as stated above, only in the GSTR-2B of the concerned tax-period.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Question 2: If any original record is rejected by the recipient and supplier furnishes the same record in GSTR-1A of same tax period or in the amendment table of GSTR-1/IFF of subsequent period, till the specified time limit, then what impact it will have on supplier’s liability? </b></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> In case supplier had furnished an original record in GSTR-1/IFF but the same record was rejected wrongly by the recipient in IMS. In such cases supplier on noticing the same in the supplier’s view of IMS dashboard or on request of recipient, may furnish the same record again (without any change) in GSTR-1A of same tax period or in the amendment table of GSTR-1/IFF in any subsequent period, till the specified time limit, then the liability of supplier will not increase.  As amendment table take delta value only. Thus, in present case of same values, differential liability increase will be zero.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Question 3: As a recipient taxpayer, how to reverse ITC of wrongly rejected Credit note in IMS as the corresponding GSTR-3B has already been filed? </b></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> In such cases recipient can request the concerned supplier to furnish the same Credit note (CN) without any change in the same return period’s GSTR-1A or in amendment table of subsequent period’s GSTR-1/IFF. Now recipient can reverse the availed ITC based on the amended CN by accepting the CN on IMS. Hence, the recipient’s ITC will get reduced with complete amended value, as soon as the recipient recomputes GSTR-2B on IMS. The reduced value is same as that of the value of original CN as in this case the complete original CN was rejected by the recipient.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Question 4: If any original Credit note was rejected by the recipient and supplier furnishes the same credit note in GSTR-1A of same tax period or in the amendment table of GSTR-1/IFF of any future tax-period, till the specified time limit, then what impact it will have on supplier’s liability? </b></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> At first instant the supplier’s liability will be added back in the open GSTR-3B return, because of original credit note rejection by the recipient. However, as the supplier furnishes the same credit note in GSTR-1A of same tax period or in amendment table of GSTR-1/IFF in any subsequent period, supplier’s liability for this amendment will get reduced again corresponding to the value of amended CN (which in this case is same as original). Thus, net effect on liability of supplier will be only once.</p>
