<title>[Returns] Advisory &amp; FAQ on Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement &amp; RCM Liability/ITC Statement</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>1.&nbsp;	To ensure correct and accurate reporting of reversed and reclaimed ITC and to avoid clerical mistakes, <b><i>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement (Reclaim Ledger)</i></b> was introduced on the GST portal from <i>August 2023 return period onwards for monthly taxpayers and from July-September 2023 quarter for quarterly taxpayers.</i> This Reclaim Ledger captures the ITC temporarily reversed in Table 4(B)2 and its subsequent reclaim in Table 4(A)5) and 4(D)1. </p>

<p>2.&nbsp;	As of now taxpayer get a <b>warning message</b> if a taxpayer attempts to re-claim excess ITC in table 4D(1) than the available ITC reversal balance but the taxpayer is allowed to file its Form GSTR-3B.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;	To the taxpayers multiple opportunities have been given to report their opening balance which was earlier reversed ITC but was not reclaimed till that time, for the newly introduced Reclaim Ledger. </p>

<p>4.&nbsp;	This statement can be viewed by the taxpayer by navigating to the <b>Dashboard › Services › Ledger › Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed</b>.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;	To assist taxpayers in correctly reporting Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) transactions, another statement called <b>"RCM Liability/ITC Statement" (RCM Ledger)</b> was introduced on the GST Portal from August 2024 onwards for monthly filers and from July-September-2024 period for quarterly filers. The ledger captures and track the RCM liability shown in Table 3.1(d) of GSTR-3B and its corresponding ITC claimed in Table 4A(2) and 4A(3) of GSTR-3B for each return period. 
</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;	A <b>warning message</b> comes to the taxpayer in case the ITC claimed in Table 4(A)2 and 4(A)3 exceed the closing balance of RCM ledger plus the liabilities being reported in Table 3.1(d).</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;	To the taxpayers multiple opportunities have been given to report the RCM ITC opening balance and amend the opening balance for both the said statements where any transaction related to excess ITC reversal or excess RCM liability/ITC prior to implementation of the said statements could be declared as opening balance to these statements.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp;	This RCM Liability/ITC Statement can be accessed through:<b> Services >> Ledger >> RCM Liability/ITC Statement</b>.</p>

<p>9.&nbsp;	Now, the taxpayers are hereby informed that, shortly, negative values or availment of excess ITC over and above available balance, shall not be allowed in both the ledgers. Both the statements shall have a below mentioned validation for regulation of ITC:  
<ul>a.&nbsp;	The reclaimed ITC in Table 4(D)(1) shall be lesser than or equal to the combined values of closing balance of <b><i>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement</i></b> and ITC being reversed in Table 4(B)(2) of current period GSTR-3B. and,</ul>
<ul>b.&nbsp;	The RCM ITC claimed in Table 4(A)2 & 4(A)3 shall be equal to or less than the combined values of RCM liabilities paid in Table 3.1(d) of the same GSTR-3B and closing balance of RCM Liability/ITC Statement.</ul></p>

<p>10.&nbsp;	In case the taxpayers are already having negative closing balance in <b><i>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement or RCM Liability/ITC Statement</b></i>, the system will not allow such taxpayers to file their GSTR-3B until:</p>

<p><ul>a.&nbsp;	Mandatorily reversal of such excess claimed ITC (Negative closing balance) as per <b><i>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement</b></i> is made in Table 4(B)(2) of current period GSTR-3B. In case there is no ITC available in current period, this reversal declared in table 4(B)2 will be added to the liability of the taxpayer in current period while filing GSTR-3B. </ul></p>

<p><ul>b.&nbsp;	For negative balance in <b><i>RCM Liability/ITC Statement</b></i>, taxpayer need to either pay the additional RCM liability equivalent to negative closing balance in Table 3.1(d) or reduce the ITC claimed in Table 4A(2) or 4A(3) to the extent of closing balance in the current return period.</ul></p>

<p>11.&nbsp;	For more information on <b><i>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement</b></i> please refer the advisory dated 17th September, 2024 issued by GSTN by clicking below link <a href="https://tutorial.gst.gov.in/downloads/news/itc_pending_ledger.pdf" target="blank">https://tutorial.gst.gov.in/downloads/news/itc_pending_ledger.pdf</a>.

<p><u><b>FAQs related to Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement and RCM Liability/ITC Statement</b></u></p>

<p><b>1.&nbsp;How to view my Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement?</b></p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can view the statement by navigating to the <b>Dashboard</b> &rsaquo; <b>Services</b> &rsaquo; <b>Ledger</b> &rsaquo; <b>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed.</b></p>

<p><b>2.&nbsp;How to view my RCM Liability/ITC Statement?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can view the RCM Liability/ITC Statement by navigating to the  <b>Dashboard</b> &rsaquo; <b>Services</b> &rsaquo; <b>Ledger</b> &rsaquo; <b>RCM Liability/ITC Statement.</b> </p>

<p><b>3.&nbsp;What will be changed in the GSTR-3B in respect of <i>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement?</i></b></p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly, taxpayer will not be able to file their GSTR-3B in case the ITC claimed in Table 4D&#40;1&#41; exceeds the closing balance in the <i><b>Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement &#40;ITC reclaim ledger&#41;</i></b> and the ITC reversed in Table 4B&#40;2&#41; of the current return period putting together.</p>


<p><b>4.&nbsp;How to file GSTR-3B if closing balance of Electronic Credit Reversal and Re-claimed Statement &#40;ITC reclaim ledger&#41; is already Negative?</b><p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the closing balance of the ITC reclaim ledger is negative, it indicates that excess ITC was reclaimed earlier. Therefore, to file GSTR-3B, you must reverse the excess claimed ITC in Table 4B&#40;2&#41; of the respective return period, up to the amount of the negative closing balance. This will allow you to correct the discrepancy and proceed with filing the return. In case there is no ITC available, this reversal declared in table 4&#40;B&#41;2 will be added to your liability in current period while filing GSTR-3B.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: The closing balance of the ITC reclaim ledger for the current return period is -&#8377;10,000, which means &#8377;10,000 of excess ITC has been reclaimed in earlier periods. To file your GSTR-3B, you would need to reverse this earlier excess reclaimed ITC of &#8377;10,000 in Table 4B&#40;2&#41; for the current period.</i></p>

<p><b>5.&nbsp;How will the validation mechanism work in GSTR-3B for RCM Liability/ITC Statement?</b>.<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxpayers will not be able to file GSTR-3B in case the claimed RCM ITC in Table 4A&#40;2&#41; or 4A&#40;3&#41; exceeds the available balance in the RCM Liability/ITC Statement and the RCM liability reported in Table 3.1&#40;d&#41; for the current return period put together. </p>



<p><b>6.&nbsp;How to file GSTR-3B if closing balance of RCM Liability/ITC Statement is Negative?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the closing balance of the RCM Liability/ITC Statement is negative, it indicates that excess RCM ITC has been claimed earlier. To proceed with filing, you must either pay the outstanding RCM liability in Table 3.1&#40;d&#41; or reduce the ITC being claimed in Table 4A&#40;2&#41; or 4A&#40;3&#41; in the current return period, equivalent the amount of the negative closing balance. Once the discrepancy is corrected, you will be able to file your return.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s assume that the closing balance of the RCM Liability/ITC Statement is -&#8377;5,000. This means that &#8377;5,000 of excess RCM ITC has been claimed earlier. To resolve this and file your GSTR-3B, you can:</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Pay the RCM liability</b>: You can pay additional &#8377;5,000 in Table 3.1&#40;d&#41; for the current return period to cover the excess ITC claimed.</p>
<b>OR</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Reduce the ITC claimed</b>: You can reduce &#8377;5,000 from the RCM ITC in Table 4A&#40;2&#41; or Table 4A&#40;3&#41; for the same period, if RCM ITC is available more than &#8377;5,000 in current period.</p>


<p>Once either the excess RCM liability is paid or the requisite ITC is reduced from available ITC to match the available negative closing balance, the discrepancy will be resolved, and you can proceed with filing your return.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
 
<ol>
<li>
<p>Table 3.2 of Form GSTR-3B captures the inter-state supplies made to unregistered persons, composition taxpayers, and UIN holders out of the total supplies declared in Table 3.1 & 3.1.1 of GSTR-3B and is auto-populated from corresponding supplies declared in GSTR-1, GSTR-1A, and IFF in the requisite tables.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It is to inform you that from <b>November-2025 tax period onwards</b>, value of supplies auto-populated in Table 3.2 of GSTR-3B from the returns/forms mentioned above, shall be made <b>non-editable</b>. The GSTR-3B shall be filed henceforth with the system generated auto-populated values only in table 3.2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Further, in case any modification/amendment is required in the auto-populated values of Table 3.2 of GSTR-3B, then the same can be done through GSTR-1A for the same tax period. The values thus reported in GSTR-1A shall change the auto-populated values of table 3.2 in GSTR-3B instantly and the taxpayers can file their GSTR-3B with the updated values. Moreover, the amendment of such supplies can always be reported in Form GSTR-1/IFF filed for subsequent tax periods.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To ensure that GSTR-3B is filed accurately with the correct values with no hassle of frequent amendments, it is advised to report the correct values in GSTR-1, GSTR-1A, or IFF. This will ensure the auto-populated values in Table 3.2 of GSTR-3B are accurate and compliant with GST regulations.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p><u><b>FAQ’s</b></u></p>
<ul> 
<li><p><b>What are the recent changes related to reporting supplies in Table 3.2?</b></p>
<p>Starting from the November 2025 tax period, the auto-populated values in Table 3.2 of GSTR-3B for inter-state supplies made to unregistered persons, composition taxpayers, and UIN holders will be non-editable, and taxpayers will need to file their GSTR-3B with the system-generated auto-populated values only.</p></li>

<li> <p><b>How can I rectify values in Table 3.2 of GSTR-3B if incorrect values have been auto-populated after November 2025 period onwards due to incorrect reporting of the same through GSTR-1?</b></p>
<p>If incorrect values are auto-populated in Table 3.2 after November 2025, then the taxpayers need to correct the values by making amendments through Form GSTR-1A for the same tax period. The values thus reported in GSTR-1A shall change the auto-populated values of table 3.2 in GSTR-3B instantly and the taxpayers can file their GSTR-3B with the updated values.</br>
Moreover, the amendment of such supplies can always be reported in Form GSTR-1/IFF filed for subsequent tax periods.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Till what time/date I can amend values furnished in GSTR-1 through Form GSTR-1A?</b></p>
<p>As there is no cut-off date for filing Form GSTR-1A before GSTR-3B which means Form GSTR-1A can be filed after filing Form GSTR-1 and till the time of filing Form GSTR-3B.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Registration shall be granted electronically within three working days from the date of generation of the Application Reference Number (ARN), subject to successful Aadhaar authentication.</p>

<p>Taxpayers opting for registration under Rule 14A are advised to take note of the following conditions, in case they intend to withdraw from the Scheme at a later stage:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• All returns due from the effective date of registration up to the date of filing the withdrawal application must be filed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The taxpayer must have filed:</p>

<title>[Returns] Advisory : Introduction of Import of Goods details in IMS</title>
<description><![CDATA[
 
<ul><p>The Invoice Management System (IMS) was introduced on the GST portal from the October 2024 tax period. It enables recipient taxpayers to accept, reject, or keep pending their individual records uploaded by their suppliers through GSTR-1/1A/IFF.  To further enhance the taxpayer convenience, a new section for "Import of Goods" has been introduced in IMS wherein the Bill of Entry (BoE) filed by the taxpayer for import of goods including import from SEZ, will be made available in the IMS for taking allowed action on individual BoE. This functionality will be available from Oct-2025 period onwards. </p></ul>

<ul><p>It may be noted that, If no action is taken on an individual BoE, it will be treated as deemed accepted and based on the action taken, the GST Portal will generate the draft GSTR 2B for the recipient on 14th of subsequent month. Please <a href="https://tutorial.gst.gov.in/downloads/news/creative_advisory_on_boe_in_ims_final_30th_october_2025.pdf" target="blank"> click here </a>to read the detailed advisory on the new changes.</p></ul>

<title>[Returns] Attention : Important Advisory on IMS</title>
<description><![CDATA[
 
<p> It has come to notice that some posts are circulating incorrect information regarding changes in GST return filing from October 1, 2025. We would like to clarify the following: </p>

<p>I.    No Change in Auto-Population of ITC:
Input Tax Credit (ITC) will continue to auto-populate from GSTR-2B to GSTR-3B without any manual intervention. The mechanism of auto-population remains unchanged due to the implementation of the Invoice Management System (IMS).</p>

<p>II.   GSTR-2B Generation
<ul>
<li>    GSTR-2B will continue to be generated automatically on the 14th of every month, without any manual intervention by taxpayers or based on the actions taken by the taxpayers.
<li>    Taxpayers can take actions in IMS even after generation of GSTR-2B till filing of GSTR-3B and can regenerate GSTR-2B accordingly, if required.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>III.  Credit Note Handling (Effective October 2025 period onward)
<ul>
<li>    Recipient taxpayers will have the option to keep a Credit Note or related document pending for a specified period.</li>
<li>    On acceptance of Credit Note or related document, the recipient will also have the flexibility to reduce ITC only to the extent of its availment by adjusting the reversal amount manually.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<title>[Returns] Advisory: New Changes in Invoice Management System (IMS)</title>
<description><![CDATA[
 
<p>This is to bring to your notice that several new changes have been introduced in the Invoice Management System (IMS) to simplify the taxation system and reduce the compliance burden on the taxpayers. The following are the key updates </p>

<p><b>Pending action for specified records:</b> Taxpayers can keep specified records pending for a limited time period. For monthly taxpayers, this period is one tax period (months), for quarterly taxpayers also it is one tax period (quarter) only. The specified records which can be kept pending in the system are mentioned below</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Credit notes, or upward amendment of Credit note </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	 Downward amendment of CN where original CN rejected</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Downward amendment of Invoice / DN only where original Invoice already accepted and 3B has been filed  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	ECO-Document downward amendment only where original accepted, and 3B has been filed</p>

<p><b>Declaring ITC reduction amount: </b></p>

<p>It is clarified that, in cases where the recipient has not availed Input Tax Credit (ITC) in respect of the relevant invoice or document, no reversal of ITC shall be warranted. Further, in cases where ITC has been availed only partially, the obligation to reverse ITC shall be limited to the extent of such availment.</p>


<p>Therefore, In IMS a facility has been made available to taxpayers to declare the amount of ITC actually availed and, to the extent applicable, required to be reversed in respect of the selected record. The said facility permits reversal of ITC, either in full or in part, by entering the amount availed to be reversed. This facility may also be utilized in cases where the taxpayer has already effected such reversal, either wholly or partially, at an earlier point of time, or where the ITC pertaining to the relevant invoice or document was never availed.  Such facility is provided for the afore-mentioned specified records. </p>


<p><b>Option to save remarks:</b> Taxpayers can now save remarks while taking reject or pending action on records. This optional facility allows taxpayers to add remarks (will be rolled out shortly). Such remarks will be visible in GSTR-2B for future reference and to suppliers in the Outward Supplies view dashboard, to take corrective measures.</p>

<p><b>Important Dates:</b></p>

<p>The changes of keeping credit notes pending and declaring the ITC amount, as mentioned above shall be made effective on the portal from October tax period.  </p>

<p>Due date for keeping records pending: The due date for keeping records pending is calculated based on the date/ tax period in which such documents has been communicated by the supplier.</p>

<p><b>Prospective Application:</b></p>

<p>The new changes will be available only for records filed by suppliers after the production rollout of these changes. Taxpayers are advised to carefully review these changes before taking action and filing their returns.</p>
